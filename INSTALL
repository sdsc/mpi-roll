This roll bundles various flavors of the MPI library.  To install, execute
these instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting
in this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll mpi
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll mpi | bash

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs MPI environment module
files in /opt/modulefiles/mpi/.(compiler).

This roll source supports building specified flavors of MPI with different
compilers and for different network fabrics.  By default, it builds openmpi
for ethernet using the gnu compilers.  To build for a different configuration,
use the ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER and ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLMPI='mpich mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx

The ROLLMPI variable may contain one or more of "mpich", "mpich2", "mvapich2",
and "openmpi", indicating which flavors of mpi to build; this defaults to
"openmpi".  The build process currently supports one or more of the values
"gnu", "intel", and "pgi" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".
It supports the values "ib", "mx", and "eth" for the ROLLNETWORK variable,
defaulting to "eth".

This roll also supports the ROLLOPTS make variable.  If it contains 'avx',
options are passed to the compiler to produce AVX instructions.  If ROLLOPTS
contains one or both of 'torque' and 'sge', then openmpi is built to integrate
with the specified scheduler(s).  If ROLLOPTS contains 'torus', then mvapich2
is compiled with 3d torus support.

This roll bundles various flavors of the MPI library.  To install, execute
these instructions on a Rocks development machine (e.g., a frontend), starting
in this directory:

% make
% rocks add roll *.iso
% rocks enable roll mpi
% cd /export/rocks/install
% rocks create distro
% rocks run roll mpi | bash

In addition to the software itself, the roll installs MPI environment module
files in /opt/modulefiles/mpi/.(compiler).

This roll source supports building specified flavors of MPI with different
compilers, for different network fabrics, and optional integration with the
gridengine and Torque load managers.  By default, it builds mpich, mpich2,
mvapich2, and openmpi using the gnu compilers for ethernet with NO integration
with load managers. To compile in load manager support for openmpi set either
SGE, or TORQUE variables to any value. 

To build for a different configuration, use the  ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER and
ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.

make ROLLMPI='mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx TORQUE=True

to add support for TORQUE (not you must have torque installed for the compile
of openmpi to complete properly).

Similarly, if you want SGE, the above would be 
make ROLLMPI='mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx SGE=True

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel", "pgi",
and "gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It uses any
ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate openmpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named openmpi_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, openmpi_mx, etc.).

This roll also supports the ROLLOPTS make variable.  If it contains 'avx',
options are passed to the compiler to produce AVX instructions.

The mpi Roll provides MPICH2, MVAPICH2 and OpenMPI for a Rocks cluster.  It
installs the software in /opt/mpich2, /opt/mvapich2, and /opt/openmpi on both
client and server hosts.  Both static and shared MPI libraries are included
with the MPICH2 and MVAPICH2 installations; for OpenMPI, only static libraries
are provided.  Binaries and libraries produced with the GNU compilers are always
included.  If the PGI and/or Intel compilers are available, compatible versions
of the MPI binaries and libraries are also installed in subdirectories of each
implementation installation directories.

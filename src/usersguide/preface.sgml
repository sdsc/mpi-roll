The mpimx Roll provides MX-enabled MPICH, MPICH2, and OpenMPI for a Rocks
cluster.  It installs the software in /opt/mpich_mx, /opt/mpich2_mx, and
/opt/openmpi_mx on both client and server hosts.  Both static and shared MPI
libraries are included with the MPICH and MPICH2 installations; for OpenMPI,
only static libraries are provided.  Binaries and libraries produced with the
GNU compilers are always included.  If the PGI and/or Intel compilers are
available, compatible versions of the MPI binaries and libraries are also
installed in subdirectories of each implementation installation directories.
(Because of PGI v8.0 compiler bugs, no PGI version of MPICH2 is included.)

This roll source supports building with different compilers and for different
network fabrics.  By default, it builds using the gnu compilers for ethernet.
To build for a different configuration, use the ROLLCOMPILER and ROLLNETWORK
make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel" and
"gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It uses any
ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate openmpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named openmpi_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, openmpi_mx, etc.).

If the ROLLCOMPILER and/or ROLLNETWORK variables are specified, their values
are incorporated into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "mpi_intel_ib"; it contains and
installs similarly-named rpms.

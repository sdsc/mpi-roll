This roll source supports building specified flavors of MPI with different
compilers, for different network fabrics, and optional integration with the gridengine and Torque load managers.  By default, it builds mpich,
mpich2, mvapich2, and openmpi using the gnu compilers for ethernet with 
NO integration with load managers. To compile in load manager support for
openmpi set either SGE, or TORQUE variables to any value. 

To build for a different configuration, use the  
ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER and ROLLNETWORK make variables, e.g.

make ROLLMPI='mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx TORQUE=True

to add support for TORQUE (not you must have torque installed for the compile
of openmpi to complete properly).

Similarly, if you want SGE, the above would be 
make ROLLMPI='mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx SGE=True


The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel", "pgi",
and "gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It uses any
ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate openmpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named openmpi_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, openmpi_mx, etc.).

The ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER, and ROLLNETWORK variables values are incorporated
into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "mpi_intel_ib"; it contains and
installs similarly-named rpms.

This roll also supports the ROLLOPTS make variable.  If it contains 'avx',
options are passed to the compiler to produce AVX instructions.

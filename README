This roll source supports building specified flavors of MPI with different
compilers and for different network fabrics.  By default, it builds mpich,
mpich2, mvapich2, and openmpi using the gnu compilers for ethernet.  To build
for a different configuration, use the ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER and ROLLNETWORK
make variables, e.g.,

make ROLLMPI='mpich2 openmpi' ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=mx

The build process currently supports one or more of the values "intel" and
"gnu" for the ROLLCOMPILER variable, defaulting to "gnu".  It uses any
ROLLNETWORK variable value(s) to load appropriate openmpi modules, assuming
that there are modules named openmpi_$(ROLLNETWORK) available (e.g.,
openmpi_ib, openmpi_mx, etc.).

The ROLLMPI, ROLLCOMPILER, and ROLLNETWORK variables values are incorporated
into the names of the produced roll and rpms, e.g.,

make ROLLCOMPILER=intel ROLLNETWORK=ib

produces a roll with a name that begins "mpi_intel_ib"; it contains and
installs similarly-named rpms.
